I tried a few solvers, the ones that gave steps just brute forced it
until I found this site: https://www.sudoku9x9.com/howtosolve/

*** It starts with identifying if row7 col1 is a "7", then following
    that to a conclusion of how 7's are handled causes column 7 to
    have no "7"s - so therefore row7 col1 cannot be a 7.  (Nishio
    strategy)

    --> So the strategy is try a number and see if when the results of
        that are propagated via "RemovedSolvedFromNeighbors" it makes
        the board invalid.

    --> The other basic propagation it uses for these trials is
        something like "OnlyOnePossibility" - IE there's only one cell
        in a row, column, or box that is left that can be a value.

*** The next strategy it does is "Guess" where it picks a cell with 2
    possibilities and tries one.  In this case it tried a 1 in row0
    col6 (which can only be 1 or 4).

*** Then it "Guess"es a 4 for row0 col7 (which could only be 4 or 6 at
    this point)

*** It then finds a 5,7,8 triple in the top right box

*** It then "Tries" a 7 in row8 col8 and concludes that would make an
    invalid board (by forcing there to be no way for there to be a "4"
    in column 4 after 11(!!!) substeps. --> so row8 col8 cannot be a 7

*** Then if row7 col8 is a "5" that would make an invalid board, so it
    concludes that is not possible. (they call this "Nishio")



*** Several steps later it does a "Forcing Chain".  This involves
    trying each value of a pair, and seeing if both values of that
    pair result in some known change in some other cell.  For example
    if a cell can be either 4 or 9, and in either case it forces some
    other cell to never have a 9 then you know that no matter what the
    value of the original cell is, the target cell cannot have a 9.

    This could also result in the target cell having a known value -
    IE no matter whether the source cell is 4 or 9, some target cell
    will have a 5 in either case.

*** Another strategy is "coloring", which is like forcing chains
    except the choice is not the possible 2 values of one cell, but
    which of 2 values in a row (or column or box) will have that digit
    causing the same thing to happen to some target cell.
